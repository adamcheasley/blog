              Plone: Content icons for Archetypes and Dexterity
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div id="post-body">
            <p>
              Due to the slow move from Archetypes to Dexterity, I have been dealing
              with a lot of sites recently that contain both Archetypes and Dexterity
              content types mixed together. For the most part this works fine, but there
              are a few places where you find yourself writing different code depending
              on which type of object you have at any one time.
            </p>
            <p>
              A perfect example of this came up recently; when trying to list
              objects within a folder that were from both types. The problem came
              when trying to show icons for these objects. In Archetypes, you could
              simply do:<br /><br />
              <code>
                plone_view.getIcon()
              </code><br />
              <br />
              This would return you an object which implements IContentIcon, on which
              you would usually call the html_tag method. This would give you a fully
              formed img tag which you could put straight into a template. With
              dexterity, this is now deprecated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The difference with dexterity is that in an Archetypes definition of
              a content type, you would define a content_icon property:<br /><br />
              <code>
                &lt;property name="content_icon"&gt;MyType.gif&lt;/property&gt;
              </code><br /><br />
              where as in dexterity, we now define an icon expression:<br /><br />
              <code>
                &lt;property name="icon_expr"&gt;string:++resource++my.package/images/my_type.png&lt;/property&gt;
              </code><br /><br />
              The former is assumed to be in a skins folder, the latter is an expression
              containing the path to the image.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fix here involves using the portal types tool and this handy function
              from CMFCore called 'createExprContext':<br /><br />
              <pre>
                from Products.CMFCore.Expression import createExprContext

                portal_types_tool = api.portal.get_tool('portal_types')
                type_info = portal_types_tool.getTypeInfo(portal_type)
                icon_ob = type_info.getIconExprObject()
                portal = api.portal.get()
                exp_context = createExprContext(
                portal, portal, portal)
                return icon_ob(exp_context)
              </pre>
            </p>
	    <p>
	      This will return an absolute path to the icon in the context of the
	      portal. This can then be used in tal for either archetypes or dexterity.
